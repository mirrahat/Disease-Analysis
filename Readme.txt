GlucoTrack: Diabetes Risk Prediction Web App

GlucoTrack is a Streamlit-powered web application that predicts the risk of Type II Diabetes using machine learning. Built using Python and real-world health data, the app allows users to input personal metrics and receive instant risk predictions along with recommendations and explanations.

About the Project
This capstone project was developed as part of the Master of Data Analytics program at Melbourne Institute of Technology. Our aim was to apply machine learning for preventative healthcare by building a user-friendly tool that supports early detection of diabetes.

Key Features
- Predict diabetes risk based on:
  - Glucose
  - BMI
  - Insulin
  - Age
  - Blood Pressure
  - Pregnancies
- User-friendly interface with clean UI
- Multiple ML models tested; Gradient Boosting selected
- Risk-level based recommendation system
- Explainability using SHAP plots
- Live charts and visualizations

Tech Stack
Language       : Python
Framework      : Streamlit
ML Libraries   : scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, shap
Visualization  : Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
UI Styling     : Custom CSS (diabetes_theme.css)

How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository:
   # Clone from your preferred source or download the project files
   cd Diabetes-prediction

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the app:
   streamlit run main.py

Model Performance
- Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Accuracy: ~91%
- ROC-AUC Score: ~90%
- Explanation: SHAP plots show the influence of features like Glucose, BMI, and Age.

Impact and Relevance
This project demonstrates how data science can empower preventative healthcare:
- Helps users assess diabetes risk early
- Aids clinicians with a visual, interpretable tool
- Encourages data-driven health decisions
