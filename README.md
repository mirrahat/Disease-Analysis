# 🩺🔎 GlucoTrack: Web App for Predicting Diabetes Risk

## 🚀 Project Overview
**GlucoTrack** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that leverages machine learning to assess the likelihood of **Type II Diabetes**. Developed in Python and trained on real medical datasets, the app enables users to enter their health information and instantly receive a risk assessment, along with tailored advice and interpretability features.

> 🎓 Created as a capstone for the Master of Data Analytics at Melbourne Institute of Technology, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning for proactive healthcare and early diabetes risk identification.
